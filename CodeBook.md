[68] "Activity"  

Subject.ID is an integer from 1 to 30 identifying the subject for which data was collected.
All acceleration features are measured in standard gravity units "g".
All Gyroscope features are measured in radians/second
Body acceleration is calculated by measuring the total acceleration and subtracting acceleration from gravity.
Jerk features measure the change in linear acceleration or angular velocity over time.
Magnitude features are calculated for each feature with XYZ components using the Euclidean norm.
Each variable has a mean value and a standard deviation value.

At the end of processing, a second data set is created with averages for each variable calculated for each activity for each subject.
The resulting data set is stored in a text file called "Tidy_data.txt".
